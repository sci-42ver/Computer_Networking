- How does v2ray manipulates with https when inbound only has http/socks protocals which all doesn't support encryption natively.
  - v2ray seems to [not support https inbound](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/discussions/2420)
  - Anyway socks is just [one proxy](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/726) but not caring about encryption.
    > that first unencrypted part (between your browser and the proxy) is completely internal to your computer, so it *doesn't matter that it is unencrypted.*
    - Also [see](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/254910) and [this](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/254909/is-plain-socks5-secure#comment524588_254909)
      > If you are *connecting to a HTTPS site*, the traffic payloads will be encrypted.
      > without the SSH encryption, though you may be protected by HTTPS
